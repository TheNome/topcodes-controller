topcodes-controller
===================


Program design underneath the GVIS Lab at GRC.


Current to do:
  
  1. Display TOPCode X,Y coordinates under or above the TOPCode
  
  2. Create a button onto the java display - COMPLETE
  
  3. Set 1 (one) TOPCode as the origin reset tool
  
  4. Reset video's origin to selected code's X,Y coordinates using button
  

We are not the owners of the TOPCode source, nor do we claim to be.  We are using their public source code to design our
own experiment using TOPCodes.  All of our code is public via this Git page.
