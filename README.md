topcodes-controller
===================


Program design underneath the GVIS Lab at GRC.

Current to do:
  Display TOPCode X,Y coordinates under or above the TOPCode
  Create a button onto the java display - COMPLETE
  Set 1 (one) TOPCode as the origin reset tool
  Reset video's origin to selected code's X,Y coordinates using button
  
We are not the owners of the TOPCode source, nor do we claim to be.  We are using their public source code to design our
own experiment using TOPCodes.  All of our code is public via this Git page.
